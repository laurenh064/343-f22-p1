    <ol>
      <li>Your site must contain at least five separate pages, each having a meaningful purpose. One of the files should
        be named index.html. Your pages must link to each other in a logical and meaningful flow.<ul>
          <li>Each page of our website shows meaningful and independent information. They all link to each other through
            the navigation bar at the top of each page.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Each page must declare its favicon (fine and possibly preferred to use the same one for all pages).<ul>
          <li>The CDC club log0 is the favicon for each page.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Your site must include some sort of header.<ul>
          <li>Every page has a <code>header</code> element, which only contains the navbar.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Your site must include some sort of navigation links.<ol>
          <li>Navigation bar - the navigation bar present on all webpages has links to all five of the pages.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>Your site must support distinct layouts for large and small screens using media queries. Use comments to note
        where you completed this activity. You may do this in a variety of ways. Consider using this to control images
        or switching blocks between rows (for large screens) and columns (for small).<ol>
          <li>Navigation bar - the navigation bar will collapse when the screen becomes small. The links are still
            accessible through the hamburger icon that appears.</li>
          <li><code>about.html</code> - on small screens, the officer cards will reduce in size. The carousel at the top
            of the page will also resize to prevent it from taking up a large portion of the page on small screens. The
            carousel&#39;s captions also disappear to accomodate the reduced size of the carousel.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>Your site must include images, and their alt attributes must adequately describe the image content to users of
        screen readers, users with images disabled, and webcrawlers.<ul>
          <li>Each page was run through a validator to ensure <code>alt</code> attributes were added to all images.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Each page and stylesheet of your site must validate without any warnings or errors using the Nu Validator
        Links to an external site.and WAVE Web Accessibility Evaluator Links to an external site.<ul>
          <li>All pages were validated with both websites.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Your site must use at least two different font faces. Headings are often rendered in a sans-serif font, and
        paragraph copy in a serif font.<ul>
          <li>The majority of the page is rendered with the <code>Open sans</code> sans-serif font. Small portions of
            text are rendered with <code>Source serif</code> as our serif font. We preferred the look of
            <code>Open sans</code> because we felt that the sans-serif font style looked more modern and sleek.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Your site must include at least one form. The form need not do anything at this point in your learning, but it
        must be present and it must use built-in content verification. Like all content, it must be neatly aligned.<ul>
          <li>We chose to have a contact page as our form. In order for the form to be submitted, all the fields must be
            filled out. The email input must also match a valid email format (contain an &#39;@&#39; symbol with text
            after it).</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Your site must include links to external sites.<ol>
          <li><code>index.html</code> - the landing page contains three links to the club&#39;s social media.</li>
          <li><code>contact.html</code> - contains an additional link to the club&#39;s discord server.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
    </ol>
